# Yolo-Comparison-on-BCCD
This repository contains code to train and evaluate multiple YOLO versions (YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, etc.) on the BCCD dataset for blood cell detection. It includes dataset preprocessing, training scripts, and model evaluation. The models are compared based on precision, recall, mAP, FPS, model size, and training time.
